\f0\fs24 \cf0 One sentence that isn\'92t tagged as expected is \'93singing is fun .\'94 The result should be VG V N . because singing is a verb participle; however, it appears as a noun. This is due to the fact that during the backtrace process, a noun is more likely to appear before a verb, while for \'93singing and dancing is fun,\'94 the same thing happens with \'93dancing,\'94 but not for singing as it is more likely to appear before a conjunction. Additionally, in training tags, there is no tag for question mark and exclamation mark, so when a question mark and exclamation is inputted, the tag for period appears. A greater value for U like -50 or -100 would be preferable because a U value of -5 would make it so scores of unseen words become obscured with seen words.}
